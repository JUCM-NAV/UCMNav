  ALT-F ALT-P calls the Print action in the File menu.

@b@C10@lNavigating the Workspace

The UCM Navigator allows UCMs to be constructed anywhere in
the workspace. The virtual area is larger than what is 
usually visible on the screen using 100% magnification.

When the workspace cannot be shown in its entirety, scroll bars 
appear on the right and bottom sides. Scrolling with these bars 
shows different areas of the workspace. To show more or less of
the workspace at once, click on the Scale button and choose a 
magnification level. Several useful magnification levels are 
provided:

  * Fit Map: automatically calculates a zoom level to fit all of 
     the current UCM on screen.

  * Fit Virtual Area: zooms out to show the entire workspace on 
     the screen at once. Resizing the UCM Navigator window also 
     changes the amount of the workspace visible at any given time.

@b@C10@lPath Creation

To create a path, select the Path tool by clicking on the Path
button with either the left or right mouse button. Right-clicking
the Path button will always start a new path; left-clicking will
start a new path if no path is currently selected, or continue
the currently selected path if one exists.

To begin, left-click once in the workspace to place the start
point of the path. Further clicks in the work area will extend
the current path, placing an empty point at the location of each
click and connecting the new point to the last point. If a new
point falls within the boundaries of a component, it is 
automatically bound to that component.

To begin a new path, first de-select the current path by clicking
the Select button and clicking on a blank area of the workspace,
or right-click on the Path button, or press the escape key ("Esc").
Continue as noted above.

@b@C10@lComponent Creation

To create a component, first click the Component button to select
the Component tool. Then, click and drag the left button in the 
workspace to anchor one corner of the component. Proceed to
drag the mouse to the desired location of the opposite corner.

By default new components are created as teams but all 
component characteristics can be changed by way of the 
component attributes dialog box. This dialog box is invoked 
either through a component's own popup menu or by double-
clicking on a component.

Components can also be copied and pasted through the 
appropriate functions in the Components menu or in the 
popup menu.

@b@C10@lSelecting a Component or Path Element

To select a component or a path element (including empty points,
start points and end points), click on the Select tool and 
left-click once inside the boundary of the desired component or 
element.

@b@C10@lAddition of UCM Path Elements

To add UCM elements to paths such as responsibilities, forks, 
or timers, first use the Select tool (Select button). Select the 
path point handle (small circle, use the menu Options -- Show 
Data Points) where it is desired to add the element. Right 
clicking will then bring up a context sensitive popup menu of 
applicable "single-element transformations". Each UCM element
on a path will have its own list of transformations that may be 
invoked by the user. Element attributes are also accessible 
through this popup menu.

@b@C10@lDouble-Element Transformations

Several transformations such as the creation of joins require 
the selection of two UCM elements and are thus termed "double-
element transformations". Select the first element of 
interest and then hold down the Shift key while clicking the 
second element.

Alternatively a selection rectangle can be drawn around the 
two elements by dragging out a rectangle with the select tool
chosen.

The popup menu of applicable transformations is then invoked in 
the same manner as for single-element transformations, i.e. by 
right clicking.

@b@C10@lGroup Selections

The UCM Navigator has the capability to select multiple elements
which may be either path elements or software components. 
Group selections can be used for group moves, alignments, and
deletions.

Elements (either path elements or components) may be selected 
by either selecting them individually with the Shift key pressed
or by dragging out a selection rectangle which will select all 
path elements and components inside its borders. Selection
rectangles are created simply by dragging out rectangles with 
the Select tool chosen.

If the start point of the rectangle is inside a component and it
is not desired to select and move the component, the selection 
rectangle can be drawn by holding down the Control key while 
dragging out the rectangle. Holding the Control key inhibits 
selection and subsequent moving of an enclosing component.

Alternatively both of these methods can be combined with a 
selection rectangle used to select a number of elements and the 
shift select method can be used to add additional elements to 
this group selection.

There is also a deselection mechanism whereby if the Shift key 
is pressed and a previously selected path element or component
is selected again it is deselected and removed from the list of
selected elements and components. The escape key ("Esc") 
deselects any selection.

Additionally if it is desired to select all of the path elements
and components in a map (e.g. for moving all map elements)
this can be accomplished with the "Select All Map Elements" 
operation in the Components menu or by using the "m" keyboard 
shortcut.

@b@C10@lGroup Move and Alignment Operations

Once a multiple selection of components and path elements is
made, it can be moved as a group through the use of the right
mouse button for coarse movement and Shift - arrow key 
combinations for fine control.

Moving a group of one or two elements can be done by pressing 
the Control key and right-clicking. This prevents a popup 
menu with double-element transformations to appear.

In addition once a multiple selection is made, alignment and 
distribution operations invoked by the Align main menu item can 
be performed. It should be mentioned that the editing mode has
no effect on either the group move or alignment operations. 

The Fix Components and Fix All Positions modes are intended to 
allow users to prevent undesired component and path element 
movement when the user intends simply to select elements and not 
to move them. As the group move and alignment operations are 
explicitly invoked by the user there is no need to prevent them 
based on the editing mode in effect.

@b@C10@lComponent/Path/Element/Group Deletion

To delete components, paths and path elements, select the Delete
item in their respective popup menus or press the delete key
("Del"). Paths are deleted by deleting their start point.

Multiple selections can be used for group deletion via the
delete key ("Del").

Several path elements cannot be deleted:

  * Or-Forks and And-Forks: undesired branches must be removed
     manually by deleting the first empty point on each such
     branch which follows the fork element.
     
  * Or-Joins and And-Joins: undesired branches must be removed
     manually by decomposing the first empty point on each such
     branch which precedes the join element.

  * Stubs with more than one input or output segment: segments
     must be removed manually by decomposing the first empty 
     point on each such segment which precedes or follows the
     stub. Stubs with one input segment and one output segment
     can be deleted.

  * Timers with timeout paths: the timeout path must be deleted
     first by selecting the "Delete Timeout Path" item in the
     timer's popup menu.

  * End points: the whole path or branch needs to be deleted.

  * Single empty/control point between two path elements: at 
     least one empty point must be present at any time between
     two path elements. Empty points enable path transformations
     and the addition of new path elements.

@b@C10@lAdding Plug-ins to Stubs

Plug-ins (submaps) can be added to stubs in different ways by
right-clicking on a stub:

  * Create New Sub Map: Asks for the submap name, and then 
     adds a submap of that name under the selected stub. Submaps
     can be edited in the same manner that maps are.

  * Import Plugin From File: Installs a submap from a UCM file
     into the current Stub.

  * Install Existing Plugin: Adds a submap found under another 
     Stub into the selected dynamic stub’s list of available 
     plugins. Modifications made to that submap are reflected
     globally in all stubs which contain the submap.
     
  * Image of Existing Plugin: Identical to Install Existing 
     Plugin, but makes a copy of the submap so any modifications
     to it are local and do not affect other stubs or submaps.

  * Transfer Root Map: Transforms a root map into a plugin for
     the selected stub.
    
Plug-ins can be bound to a stub by selecting how stub input and 
output segments are connected to start points and end points in 
the submap(s).

Additionally, a selection policy can be added to a dynamic stub.
This policy explains the conditions under which one or more
plug-ins are selected.

@b@C10@lSelection/Creation of Root/Plug-in Maps

The Maps menu contains a Select Map option which enables the
selection of a specific root/plug-in map to be viewed.

Additional root maps can be created with the Create New Root
map function in the same menu.

The Decomposition Level window allows the direct navigation in a 
hierarchy of plug-ins.

@b@C10@lCreation and Use of UCM Sets

UCM sets regroup root maps and plug-in maps. Sets can be used 
to restrict the navigation, to export UCMs or EPS/MIF/CGM/SVG 
graphics, or to print UCMs.

A set is created by selecting Create New UCM Set in the Maps
menu. Root maps and plug-ins can be added to the set, which
can also have a name, a description, and a primary map.

When navigating a design, the current map can be added to or
removed from any predefined UCM set (through the Maps menu).

@b@C10@lSaving and Loading UCM Designs

The File menu contains options for loading UCMs from disk. Note
that loading a UCM into memory will overwrite any existing UCMs. 
If there are unsaved changes, the UCM Navigator will present a 
dialog box asking if the current map should be saved.

UCMs may be saved to disk using either the Save or Save As 
commands in the File menu. The files are saved by default with a 
.ucm extension and are stored in XML format. Backup files 
(.ucm.bak) are automatically created.

The Options menu contains an Autosave function which can 
optionally be set to various intervals. The resulting files 
have a .aus extension. Such files can be copied and renamed
manually when the tool crashes, or can be loaded using 
Revert from Autosave in the File menu.

@b@C10@lExporting/Importing UCMs

The UCM export/import mechanism enables the concurrent
development of one or many UCM designs.

To export UCMs, select the Export Maps command in the File
menu. Options allow the export of the current UCM (with or
without the bound submaps) or of a particular UCM set.

Exported UCMs can be imported in two ways:

 * As plug-ins: choose a stub and select Import Plugin From File
    in its popup menu.

 * As root maps: select the Import Root Map command from the File
    menu or from the Maps menu.

When imported, responsibilities and components with conflicting
names can optionally be duplicated (and renamed) or transformed 
into references to existing responsibilities/components.

Further, the Utilities menu contains tools which allow duplicated
responsibilities/components to be transformed, at any time, into
references to other existing responsibilities/components.

@b@C10@lUCM Reports and Printouts

UCM reports can be printed by accessing the Print command in
the File menu. UCMs may be printed to an installed printer or to a 
PostScript (.ps) file. Under Windows, we strongly advise the
generation of a PostScript file.

When printing, options exist to specify what additional
elements should be included in the report, including the current
date and time, descriptions of elements, etc. Other options 
allow the printing of the current UCM (with or without the 
bound submaps), of a particular UCM set, or of all UCMs.

The PostScript output is PDF-enabled, i.e. hyperlinks on UCM 
stubs and plug-in names are automatically created, and an index 
is automatically generated. The PostScript files can be 
transformed into a PDF file with external tools such as Adobe
Acrobat Distiller or ps2pdf.

@b@C10@lGeneration of EPS/MIF/CGM/SVG Graphics

UCM drawings can be exported to four graphical formats:
  * .eps (Encapsulated Postscript, for publishing)
  * .mif (Maker Interchange Format, for FrameMaker) 
  * .cgm (Computer Graphics Metafile, for Office applications)
  * .svg (Scalable Vector Graphics, for Web documents)

Select the appropriate item in the File Menu.  Options allow 
the export of the current UCM (with or without the bound 
submaps), of a particular UCM set, or of all UCMs. The files
are currently being generated in the UCMNAV_HOME directory.

@b@C10@lScenario Definitions

In order to specify named end-to-end scenarios through a complex
system, which are needed for MSC/XML generation and for scenario
highlighting, it is necessary to create scenario definitions
which reference a global data model for the design.

There are three steps for creating scenario definitions.

1. Define a set of global boolean variables for the design.
2. Define logical selection conditions at branching points
   (OR-forks, timers, and dynamic stubs ) which reference 
   the global variables.
3. Define a set of scenario definitions which specify:
	* initial values for relevant variables
	* a list of path start points
	* an optional postcondition

Scenario definitions are also regrouped under scenario groups.

@b@C10@lScenario Highlight

Scenario definitions can be used in combination with a UCM path
traversal mechanism to highlight the segments that are visited.
Elements and segments visited once are colored in red, whereas 
those visited many times are in colored in orange.

Scenario highlight can be performed via the scenario window
(accessible from the Scenario menu). Right-clicking on a start
point and selecting "List Scenarios" will also generate a list
of scenarios where this start point belongs.

Once paths are highlighted, the navigation mode is restricted
to the plug-ins visited by the scenario. Removing the 
highlighting and getting back to a full navigation mode can
be done throught the scenario menu.

The traversal can generate warnings and errors along the way.
For instance, for a specific scenario definitions, there could
be non-determinism (two branches or plug-ins can be selected),
or deadlocks (conditions or synchronizations that cannot be 
fulfilled).

The colored paths can be exported in EPS/MIF/CGM/SVG files.

@b@C10@lMSC Generation

Scenario definitions can be used for generating Message
Sequence Charts in the Z.120 textual form. ".msc" files are 
created for scenarios in a way similar to scenario highlight. 
The MSC files can be visualized using commercial and research 
tools (e.g. Telelogic Tau 4.4)

@b@C10@lXML Scenario Generation

Scenario definitions can also be used for generating scenarios
in an intermediate XML format, valid according to the DTD
scenario1.dtd. Such XML scenario can be postprocessed (e.g.
with XSLT) and transformed into other representations such
as MSC, UML sequence/collaboration/activity diagrams, TTCN
test cases, etc.

@b@C10@lDOORS DXL Export

Several UCM elements can be exported to the DOORS requirements
management system. UCMNav can generate DXL scripts which can
run on DOORS and update the DOORS database. These UCM elements
can be linked to other tyoes for requirements, enabling
traceability between scenarios and external requirements. 
A DXL library is required to run the script (available upon
request to damyot@site.uottawa.ca)
