Please refer to License.html for license information.

This distribution can compile on Windows (using Cygwin), Linux (Intel) and
Solaris. You will probably need to adapt the makeflags.(nt|linux|solaris) file
to indicate where to find your files, compiler, and libraries. 

The Makefile might need to be adapted as well (at least you need to specify
which makeflags file use).

Good luck!
